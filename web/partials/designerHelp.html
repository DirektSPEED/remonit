  <p>
    Monlets are dashboard widgets that contain texts or markups.
    They scale automatically with screen size.
  </p>
  <p>
    They can embed Handlebars templates to show <a href="/monitor">monitored stats</a> live.
  </p>
  <p>
    To add a monlet, drag one of the icons from left sidebar onto the dashboard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Borders around monlets only show in the designer, not in live dashboards.
